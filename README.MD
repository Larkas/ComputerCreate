## Planing

The pack is not fully released yet, as some textures are missing (items textures and some GUIs).
I will consider this pack complete when I release these textures, but I will update the pack if the Create mod team update there textures.

There is also plan to support other mod centered on Create and ComputerCraft, such as [CC:CB](https://modrinth.com/mod/cccbridge).
